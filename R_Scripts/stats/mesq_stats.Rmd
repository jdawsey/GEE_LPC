When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

```

Import point data -> 
Correlation test ->
Eliminate correlated variables ->
Check for normality ->
Run glm ->
results


```{r}
# Logistic Regression
# where F is a binary factor and
# x1-x3 are continuous predictors
fit <- glm(F~x1+x2+x3,data=mydata,family=binomial())
summary(fit) # display results
confint(fit) # 95% CI for the coefficients
exp(coef(fit)) # exponentiated coefficients
exp(confint(fit)) # 95% CI for exponentiated coefficients
predict(fit, type="response") # predicted values
residuals(fit, type="deviance") # residuals
```
