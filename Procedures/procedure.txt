			Buffer creation
################################
In QGIS

Import leks

Create minimum bounding geometry -- 
  - constraining = leks
  - geometry = convex hull

Create random points
 - constraining = bounding geometry
 - number points = 50
 - minimum allowed distance = 10 km

Buffer each of the random points
 - 5 km radius
 - export
 - (or export as geojson)

Split buffers by string attribute (may have to create)
 - save to temp file
 - remove unsplit buffer
 - add buffers back to map from temp file
	
finally - write in console ("ctrl + alt + p" to access):
>>>for vLayer in iface.mapCanvas().layers():
    QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormat( vLayer, fileName = "C:/Users/Justin/Desktop/mesquite/mesq_jsons_work/" + vLayer.name() + ".geojson", fileEncoding = "utf-8", driverName = "GeoJSON", skipAttributeCreation = True)

			Sampling method
################################

For each buffer:
 - classify and identify mesquite
 
- create points within centroids of cell clusters

 - import data for each buffer:
	- soil
	- slope
	- pi of each landcover

For each centroid point:
 - add area of mesquite cluster as attribute of each centroid point
 
- append data to centroid points:
	- soil
	- slope
	- pi of each landcover
	- bioclim - temp and precip

 - for each individual centroid point:
	- dist nearest road
	- dist nearest mesquite
	- type surrounding habitat


################################
			Analysis method
################################
Create correlation matrix and check if normal

Multivariate regression:
 - compare number of mesquite in buffer to:
	- soil clay content, depth, and area of each class
	- soil sand content, depth, and area of each class
	- slope
	- pi
	- latitude
	- temperature
	- precipitation
 
- overall proximity of mesquite to:
	- roads
	- other mesquite

Regression comparing:
 - number of mesquite in buffer to:
	- area of each soil type
