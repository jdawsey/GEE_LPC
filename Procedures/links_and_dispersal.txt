Create a raster with slope over 15% and clip the lek buffer so that it excludes those area. Then import that new buffer into GEE.

It may also be worth creating a new buffer at 60km? See results of "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.1441".
Net displacement (km)	Dispersal: 	16.18 ± 2.77
			Foray loops:	8.84 ± 0.75
			Round-trip:	13.03 ± 1.47
