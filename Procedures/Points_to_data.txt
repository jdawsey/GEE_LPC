Points to data:

Will need to run the geojson script twice or else it may be worth just pulling in the points directly as shapefiles.

Clip wanted layers by whichever buffers we're examining or a subset of them.
Add in:
	- 1m elevation (3dep)
	- Tiger roads
	- clay content
	- sand content
	- organic carbon
	- soil water content
	- lithology
	- bioclim variables

Join info from each of the bands onto the points

Save info to a csv



May be easier to download each of the images I need, load into arcgis, then go through and "extra values to point"
