Points to data:

****It's going to be easiest to download all but the elevation layer for the whole study area then extract the data to points all at one time.


Will need to run the geojson script twice or else it may be worth just pulling in the points directly as shapefiles.

Add in:
	- 1m slope (3dep)
	- Tiger roads (find distance from road)
	- clay content - 250m
	- sand content - 250m
	- organic carbon - 250m
	- soil water content - 250m
	- lithology
	- bioclim variables - 927.67 - bio01(annual mean temp), bio07(temp annual range), bio12 (annual precipitation)

Mask out unusable features from cropland data layer
	- anything that's not pasture, shrubland, barren, or open and low development.
	- make sure to set cell size as same as original classified
	- mask ***outside***
