 Integrating Google Earth Engine and Python with reseach on the landscape ecology of lesser prairie-chickens. This repository includes data for the manuscript (in progress).

This repository will contains scripts for analyses conducted to achieve three main research goals:
1. Mapping woody shrub cover from classified imagery and environmental data layers
2. Analyzing lesser prairie-chicken lek abandonment through time
3. Mapping how connectivity of lesser prairie-chicken has degraded as habitat degraded and leks have been abandoned
